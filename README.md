# Tenzies

Github pages: https://Konrad-Romanowski.github.io/tenzies

Simple dice game written in React as a part of the [Scrimba's free React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). After finishing the course I have built again the whole app from scratch on my own and add additional features that were not covered in the course. 

#### Features added to the original project:
- added dots (pips) on the dice,
- option to switch how the dice are displayed: digits or dots (pips),
- number of rolls tracker.

## What I have learnt during the project and the course?
#### Basics of React.js:
- functional components,
- hooks:
    - useState, 
    - useEffect,
- useEffect's dependency array and cleanup function,
- passing props to a components,
- adding event listeners and handling events,
- controlled components,
- what is derived state and how to avoid it.
